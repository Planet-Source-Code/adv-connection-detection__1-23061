## Adv Connection Detection


</div>

### Description

This source code will allow you to detect if you are currently conencted to the Internet. Unlike other source code, this code also demonstrates how to return information about your connection (if any!).

The program will detect if you are currently connect to the internet and also report any of the following information:

1) If you are connected via a modem or a LAN.

2) If you are connected via a proxy

3) If your modem is busy doing something that is not Internet related.

This source code is very small and will come in very handy for anyone developing Internet applications.

Please judge my entry as this is only my second entry.
